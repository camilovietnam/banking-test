# NFON Pair Programming Task

Time to solve task: ~45 minutes

Our partner bank Gold&Gold has sent us a requirement for a new microservice to manage the account of one of their most important Customers, Richie McRich. The bank wants us to provide them with an API to do some basic banking operations on the account of monsieur Rich:
- Check the account balance
- Deposit money into the account
- Withdraw money from the account
- Reset the account balance

Please create a Go program to implement this API. We expect no unusual parameters from the customer (for example, they will only send integers to the "deposit" endpoint).
